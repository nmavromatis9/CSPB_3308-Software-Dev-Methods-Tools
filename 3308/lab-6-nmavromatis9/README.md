Flask is a web framework, which means it provides you with tools, libraries and technologies that allow you to build a web application. The web application can be as simple as a few web pages, a blog, a wiki, or as complex as a full web application with dynamic pages and access to database data.   

Flask is a micro-framework that is written in Python. It is classified as a micro-framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components, but there are many third-party libraries provide common functions.
One of the drawbacks of a light weight framework is that you will have to do more work on your own.  This is good when doing school projects, but may become cumbersome if you are working to create a complex website (100's of pages)

Flask is a back-end framework, which means that it provides the technologies, tools, and modules that can be used to build the functional rendering of pages of the web app rather than the design or look of it. Flask is considered one of the easiest frameworks to learn for beginners.    
<hr>

In this lab you will be installing the Flask application, setting up your environment to run a web service, and writing the code to render web pages in your browser.
This is an individual project where each student will create a basic web server and support a number of independent web pages. 
 
You can install Flask in a virtual environment on your local system or on the **csel.io** jupyterHub virtual machine.   If you will be working in the **csel.io** environment, there are a few extra steps to setup the flask pages to be accessed in your local browser while getting information from the virtual machine.
