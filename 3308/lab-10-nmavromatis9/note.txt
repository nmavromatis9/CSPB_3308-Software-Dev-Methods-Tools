#Steps to get flask to work on local host:

1. source venv/bin/activate

#activate venv, from correct directory

2. export FLASK_RUN_PORT=3308 

export FLASK_DEBUG=on

#This didn't work when running from .sh file. So type into BASH

3. flask --app lab10_app run

4.# Type into browser (local host): https://coding.CSEL.io/user/nima6629/proxy/3308/game 

Hope this is helpful.
